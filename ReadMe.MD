# Driver's Drowsiness Detection

## Description

Driver's Drowsiness Detection is a project aimed at detecting drowsiness in drivers using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes transfer learning with the Inception v3 model and the MRL Eyes dataset to achieve this goal. The model achieved an accuracy of 93%.

## Features

-   Detects drowsiness in real-time
-   Utilizes the Inception v3 model for high accuracy
-   Implements a web application using Streamlit for easy accessibility

## Personal Note

This application has made a significant impact on the safety of drivers in my institute, especially those who work night shifts as truck drivers. Making such projects for humanity always warms my heart, and knowing that it has helped prevent accidents and ensure the well-being of our drivers brings me great satisfaction.
